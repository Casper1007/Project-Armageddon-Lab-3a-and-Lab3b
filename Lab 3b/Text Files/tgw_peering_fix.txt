TGW Peering Route Error Fix

Issue
- Error: IncorrectState when creating TGW route in Tokyo (peering attachment not yet available).

Root Cause
- The TGW peering attachment is in a pending state when Terraform tries to create:
  - TGW route table association
  - TGW route table propagation
  - TGW route to the peer VPC CIDR

Fix Implemented
- Gate peering-related resources only when the peer TGW ID / peering attachment ID variable is set.
- Use a two-phase apply when the attachment is pending acceptance:
  1) Apply Tokyo to create the peering request.
  2) Apply Sao Paulo to accept the peering.
  3) Re-run apply in both regions to create assoc/prop/routes once AWS flips the attachment to available.

Files Updated
- tokyo_tgw.tf
  - Removed peering state data source/locals
  - Guarded TGW assoc/prop/route with presence of Sao Paulo TGW ID
  - Added depends_on to ensure the peering request exists before assoc/prop/routes
  - Disabled TGW default association/propagation to prevent auto-association conflicts

- saopaulo/sao_paulo_tgw.tf
  - Removed peering state data source/locals
  - Guarded TGW assoc/prop/route with presence of Tokyo peering attachment ID
  - Added depends_on to ensure the peering acceptance exists before assoc/prop/routes
  - Disabled TGW default association/propagation to prevent auto-association conflicts

Apply Order
1) Apply Tokyo first (creates peering request).
2) Apply Sao Paulo (accepts peering).
3) Re-run apply in both regions after the attachment becomes available.

Optional
- Re-run apply to create the peering routes once the attachment transitions to available.

AlreadyAssociated Error (TGW VPC Attachment)
Issue
- Error: Resource.AlreadyAssociated when associating the VPC attachment to the TGW route table.

Cause
- The attachment was automatically associated to the TGW default route table before Terraform took control.

Fix
1) In AWS Console (Tokyo and Sao Paulo TGW route tables):
   - Disassociate the VPC attachment from the default TGW route table (one-time cleanup).
2) Re-run Terraform apply.

CLI one-time disassociate (Tokyo example)
- aws ec2 disassociate-transit-gateway-route-table --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-0f56adf6400080f58 --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-0b12507aac954345f --region ap-northeast-1

Prevention
- Default association/propagation is disabled in Terraform for both TGWs and VPC attachments.

Resolution
- Disassociated the Tokyo VPC attachment from the non-managed TGW route table (tgw-rtb-07cb1a866d62d1b98).
- Terraform apply then succeeded.
